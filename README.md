#### Questions:
1. Please draw the following plot using Eigen::Quaterniond(w x y z) and tf::Quaternion(x y z w) in rviz.	
2. Be aware of the directions of arrows. Pointing from  A to B implies the transformation from A to B.	
3. In the first figure, vectors BA and CA are the inputs to generate output vector BC.	
4. In the second figure, vector AB is rotated by 90 degree about the z axis and vector BC is rotated by 60 degree about the z axis, and generate the output vector AC.
